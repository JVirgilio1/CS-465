Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

HTML provides us with a basic structure for web pages, and express is our Node.js framework. Java helps improve user interactivity and dynamics on the webpage. These help each webpage become unique in their own regard, and can help with better load times. Additionally, content can be mananged much easier with these frameworks. Some negatives are that page reloads are required, and server-side and client-side interactions can sometimes be slow.

Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
Multiple different reasons. Flexability, scalability, and performance advantages. MongoDB provides increased flexability over basic SQL, and helps handle a diverse data set much easier. It also shows increased performance with larger data sets.

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is a data format rather then a programming language. It represents and transmits data. Javascript is a programming language, and is used to build websites. JSON bridges the frontend and backed by using a standard format for data exchange. 

Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Code reusability is paramout to smooth development. It allows for an applicaiton to be modular, and can point to a exact location if an error occurs. This can be seen in our development with rebuliding the routes.js and controller.js to work independently.

Methods define how data is accessed and manipulated. Endpoints are specific URLs that expose functionality. Security measures like authentication and authorization ensure that only planned users can access resources. HTTP methods, which we used, include a GET (data retrival), POST (data creation), PUT (data update), and DELETE(data removal)

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has drastically improved my knowledge of website building and both front and and back end development. This can help in almost every professional setting. I also learned much more about pusing updates to github, and the basics of both Windows Powershell, Postman, Node.js and Javascript.
